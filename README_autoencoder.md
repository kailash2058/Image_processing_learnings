# Autoencoders for Image Denoising and Reconstruction

This repository contains Python code examples for implementing autoencoders using TensorFlow/Keras. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. 
They are capable of learning efficient representations of data by compressing the input into a latent-space representation and then reconstructing the output from this representation.

## Overview

Autoencoders are powerful neural networks that can be used for various tasks such as image denoising and reconstruction. In this repository, we explore two main activities:

1. **Image Denoising**: We implement an autoencoder to remove noise from images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.This activity demonstrates how autoencoders can
                         effectively denoise images by learning to reconstruct clean versions from noisy inputs.

3. **Image Reconstruction**: We train an autoencoder to reconstruct handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. This activity showcases how autoencoders can learn meaningful
                             representations of data and generate accurate reconstructions.
